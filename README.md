# MusicMaker
Visit the website: https://mark-dsouza.github.io/MusicMaker

- A Website that makes music with just one tap.
- Just **Tap** on any of the 6 colourful pads and watch the beat __*BOUNCE!*__
- I like to call it *Tap Music*.

## Breakdown of the Design:
  - Header
    - Heading
    - Tagline

- 6 Colourful Pads
  - Clicking on them results in a beat being played and a ball bouncing across your screen!
